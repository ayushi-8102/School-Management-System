# School-Management-System

## Introduction
A School management system is designed to help collages for management of dental student. Extensive information is available at your fingertips through this System. Viewing student data, managing admission, semester, faculty and for examination, subject management, scheduling exam, result related issues are made simple and easy. There are custom search capabilities to aid in finding student information and working on student records. This can make the system easier to navigate and to use maximizing the effectiveness of time and other resources. The system allows the keeping of personnel data in a form that can be easily accessed and analyzed in a consistent way.

## PROJECT SUMMARY

The system module is a component covering many other student aspects from application to retirement. The system records basic personal information, admission information, education information regarding student. Leading edge systems provide the ability to “read” applications and enter relevant data to applicable database fields, notify student and provide result. School management function involves
    • Manage new admission and enrollment
    • Student Basic Information
    • Result Management
In this system, every user has a Login ID and Password. Also all the users have different permission rights to access the applications. These rights are Dynamic and can be changed.
There are two main roles in the system. Admin and Student. Admin has complete access to the whole system. Student is the role that is responsible for the use of the system.



The Admin role can be as follow:
    • Manage subjects
    • Management of Merit List
    • Generation of student roll number
The Student role:
    • View their info and percentage
    • Check their respective ranks
Now when the user with the particular role Logs on, he can see only those pages which are allowed to them.

## PURPOSE
The project is about to handle all the information of the student regarding admission and examination. Also it manages resources which were managed and handled by manpower previously. The main purpose of the project is to integrate distinct sections of the organization into consistent manner so that complex functions can be handled smoothly by any technical or non-technical persons.
The project aims at the following matters:
    • Automation of admission and enrollment.
    • Assistance in decision-making.
    • To manage information of student.
    • Consistently update information of all the students.
    • Reports- To gather all the related information about any application.
All the above-mentioned matters are to be incorporated in the application along with some additional requirements.
The main purpose of the Admin Module is to introduce new things and configure important aspects. So the master screens for all these are visible to only admin role. This is done by the Admin Module. It also can create the users and Physical and Logical Locations. Thus the main purpose of the Admin Module is to managing the dynamic working of the system.

 ## SCOPE
The scope of the project includes the following
    • Any college can use this system as it is not client centric.
    • All admission and examination related work for the student can be done using this system.
    • Deliver Electronic Workplace
    • The Admin Module can be reused for projects as well which have many users with different rights. Hence it is reusable.

## APPLICATIONS
    • To use for various streams students.
    • To gather student’s information.
    • Different reports and queries can be generated based of vast options related to students, batch, course, semesters and even for the entire college.


## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
    • This project can be implemented in more than two languages.
    • Other possible modules:
    1. Academic
    2. Attendance management
    3. Library
    4. Hostel
